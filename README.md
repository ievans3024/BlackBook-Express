BlackBook
=========

Purpose
-------

This is a Node Express app using Angular and Bootstrap to create a contacts book. A little "black book" of sorts.

This project is a small pet learning project I put together to document my experimentation with:

* Creating a restful web api
* Creating a frontend client for said api
* Creating a single-page application that is mobile-friendly.
* Information modeling

This is still currently a work in progress. I can make no guarantee or warranty of the security or stability of it.
Use or re-use at your own risk.


Requirements
------------

* NodeJS
* CouchDB


Installation/Usage
------------------

* `npm install` from working directory to install dependencies.
* `npm run build` to build minified production application code.
* `npm run start` to run light www server for viewing the application during development.
